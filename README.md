### About Project & Features

- This is an Asp.Net Core Api project to understand Choreography-based Saga Pattern. There are 3 APIs in this case. First API is for create orders [Order.API], second API is for reserve product stock count [Stok.API], third API is for payment [Payment.API] 
- Order.API and Stock.API work with MSSQL database. Migration can be initialized for databases. SQL Connection strings are in the "appsettings.json".
- RabbitMQ (cloudamqp) was selected for message broker.
- APIs are both subcriber and publisher. Transactions can be seen in tke image below.

Main features of the application:

- OrdersController create orders in Order.API.
- Stock.API subcribe the order event and if stock balance is enough for the product, stock is reserved for the buyer. 
- Payment.API subcribe stock reserve event, if the stock count is enough and buyer credit card limit is enough then this api publishes the payment event.
- If buyers credit card limit is not enough payment failed event would published.
- If stock count is enough for othe order but the credit card limit is not enough then the reserved stock will be rollback.
