### About Project & Features

- This is an Asp.Net Core Api project to understand Choreography-based Saga Pattern. There are 3 APIs in this case. The first API is to create orders [Order.API], the second API is to reserve product stock count [Stok.API], and the third API is for payment [Payment.API] 
- Order.API and Stock.API work with MSSQL database. Migration can be initialized to create databases. SQL connection strings are in the "appsettings.json" file.
- RabbitMQ (cloudamqp) is selected for message broker in this project. RabbitMQ connection strings are in the "appsettings.json" file.
- APIs are both subcribers and publishers. Transactions can be seen in the image below.

Main features of the application:

- OrdersController creates orders in Order.API.
- Stock.API subcribes the order event and if the stock balance is enough for the product, stock is reserved for the buyer. 
- Payment.API subcribes stock reserve event, if the stock count and the buyer's credit card limit are enough, then this api publishes the payment event.
- If the buyer's credit card limit is not enough, "payment failed event" will be published.
- If the stock count is enough for the order but the credit card limit is not enough, then the reserved stock will be rolled back. 

### API Endpoints
